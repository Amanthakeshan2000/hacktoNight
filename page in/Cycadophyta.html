<p>A number of lines of seed-bearing gymnospermous plants are discernible among fossil plants of the late Paleozoic Era (542 to 251 million years ago) and early to middle Mesozoic Era (251 to 65.5 million years ago). Among them a rather loose assemblage of forms, referred to as seed ferns, or pteridosperms, is well represented. The Carboniferous Period (about 360 to 300 million years ago) especially has been called the “age of ferns” because of the abundance of fossilized fernlike leaves. In time, many of these “ferns” were recognized as seed plants, and it has been determined that seed ferns were a dominant vegetation in the late Paleozoic. Seed ferns generally are characterized as having been slender trees or, in some cases, woody, climbing vines, but generally with large, fernlike fronds.

































Characteristic seed-fern foliage consisted of large compound leaves composed of second- and sometimes third-order branches. The latter bore fernlike leaflets, hence the name seed fern, although they are only remotely related to true ferns. Seed-fern stems generally possessed variable amounts of soft, loose wood and relatively large zones of cortex and pith; in this respect they resembled the stems of cycads and differed considerably from the stems of conifers, which have compact wood and relatively small zones of cortex and pith.</p>
