<p>Bryophyta, the Moss Giantess, is an ancient and mystical moss giant boss who can be found in her lair in the Varrock Sewers. Bryophyta's lair is located just north of where the moss giants reside in the sewers, accessible by the agility shortcut from the Edgeville Dungeon (51 Agility required) or through the Varrock Sewers. 
In order to access Bryophyta's lair, the player must obtain a mossy key from a moss giant. Each mossy key permits for only one attempt, similar to accessing Obor's lair with a giant key.</p>
